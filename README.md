While exploring the official YOLOv8 documentation available at https://docs.ultralytics.com/, I encountered a challenge in obtaining a clear understanding of the feature extraction process. The documentation provides comprehensive information about various aspects of YOLOv8, but specific details related to feature extraction seem to be lacking or unclear. As a result, I've created this repository to address the need for a more explicit and accessible guide or implementation related to feature extraction from YOLOv8. The code in this repository aims to provide a practical solution for users looking to extract features from YOLOv8 (using the object detection model!) for their specific requirements.

Dependencies:
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:


pip install ultralytics
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install numpy



Repository Overview:
This repository contains code for feature extraction from YOLOv8, the latest version of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection system. The implemented code efficiently extracts features from YOLOv8 and includes a plotting component to visualize these extracted features.

How to Use:
Install the required dependencies by running the provided commands.
Navigate to the main code file and execute it to perform feature extraction.
Explore the generated plots to gain insights into the features extracted from YOLOv8.
Feel free to customize and extend the code based on your specific requirements. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please feel free to raise them in the repository's issue tracker.
